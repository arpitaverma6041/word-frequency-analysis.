Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms,
and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.
It applies techniques from many fields including statistics, computer science, and machine learning.
Data scientists use data to understand trends, build predictive models, and support decision-making.
The demand for data professionals is growing rapidly as organizations increasingly rely on data
to drive innovation and strategy. Effective data analysis helps businesses understand customer
behavior, optimize operations, and uncover new opportunities.
